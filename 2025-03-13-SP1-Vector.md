# SP1 Vector vulnerability disclosure

## Disclosure

On January 8th, 2025, the Avail team was notified of a potential vulnerability in the SP1 Vector program that is used for the Avail bridge. The Avail team promptly responded to the whitehat, initially assuming the bug to be infeasible due to an incomplete proof of concept (PoC). The vulnerability was then shared the next day with our partner, Succinct, for a proper security evaluation. We also communicated with the whitehat for a more comprehensive PoC that reflects the possible exploit. Succinct confirmed the vulnerability (and two others not included in the whitehat’s report) the following day and efforts on the fixes were started. All required fixes were finalized in an hour and a new implementation was deployed on the same day. Mainnet deployments were upgraded later that day, and the vulnerability was officially fixed. In the same timeframe, we received a completed PoC from the whitehat and we acknowledged it as a valid bug for a payout soon after.

## Impact

We have confirmed that there was no impact to the Avail bridge or SP1 Vector programs. Validity proof submissions currently require (and will require) an approved relayer (operated by Succinct) so there is an additional layer of security. We have verified that no malicious proofs that have been submitted till date.

## Causes

1. In both the `header_range` and `rotate` circuits, a user-supplied `current_authority_set_hash` is committed to as a part of the public values. This `current_authority_set_hash` is not linked to the `target_justification` so an arbitrary one can be supplied.
2. The `target_block_hash` associated with the justification that's verified is never linked to the set of headers used for computing the data commitment.
3. The user-supplied headers are not exhaustively checked. Only the first (`target_block` - `trusted_block`) headers and the last header are checked. The user can supply potentially malicious headers as a part of the commitment that are not validated. This was the issue raised through our bug bounty program.

## Fixes

1. Compute the `current_authority_set_hash` from the public keys of the validator set used for verifying the justification. This commitment is verified against an authority set hash in the contract.
2. Add a check that the last block hash in the set of headers used for computing the commitment matches the one signed by the justification.
3. Exhaustively check that the list of headers supplied by the user start with the `trusted_block`, and end with the `target_block` AND that they're all sequential and connected.

## Conclusion

This vulnerability report has highlighted the importance of having an active and high-value bug bounty program, as this bug was found in spite of conducting thorough security checks and audits on the original program. Firstly, we’d like to thank the hacker for responsibly disclosing the bug to us and working with us productively. We would like to thank Immunefi for making the platform available to us and actively triaging bugs. Lastly, we would also like to extend our thanks to our partner, Succinct, for actively working on the fixes for the vulnerability and ensuring all bugs were fixed in a timely manner.
